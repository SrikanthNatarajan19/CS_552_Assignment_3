This repository contains the solution for **Assignment 3: Variational Autoencoders** for the DS/CS552 course.

## Contents
- `CS_552_Assignment3.ipynb`  
  Jupyter notebook containing:
  - Theory questions and answers
  - Implementation of a Fully Connected VAE and a Convolutional VAE
  - Training and comparison on the CIFAR-10 dataset
  - Latent space interpolation
  - Training and analysis on a new dataset

## Notes
- Datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10, STL10) are loaded using `torchvision` in this repository.
- Trained model weights are  as results can be reproduced by running the notebook.
- All results, visualizations, and explanations are included directly in the notebook.

## How to Run
Open the notebook and run all cells from top to bottom.
